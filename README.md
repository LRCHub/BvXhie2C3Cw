[00:14.88] Who knows what next year holds?
[00:18.38] I only hope that it brings me closer to you
[00:21.82] Under the mistletoe
[00:24.73] Arms together, we're wrapped in the weather
[00:46.23] 
[00:28.17] Of Christmas cheer and joyful tears
[00:31.66] Another reason to be fallin' in love
[00:35.04] On such a wonderous night
[00:36.67] Not a hiccup in sight
[00:38.51] There's nothing else I'd want
[00:53.01] 
[00:41.96] Oh, when Christmas comes again
[00:48.38] We'll be sat under a starry sky
[00:52.36] Wishin' it never ended
[00:56.86] Every second spent
[01:02.43] Let's cherish it all
[01:06.45] Before all the lights that turned into
[01:09.11] Christmas comes again
[01:19.61] 
[01:18.99] Like carols and Christmas trees
[01:22.45] A voice from heaven
[01:23.30] So rich in the way that you glow
[01:26.13] A present that's meant for me
[01:29.39] You're the reason I never needed the snow
[01:49.89] 
[01:33.11] The soul that we bring into the season
[01:38.97] On such a wonderous night
[01:40.86] Not a hiccup in sight
[01:43.26] There's nothing else I'd want
[01:57.76] 
[01:46.43] When Christmas comes again
[01:52.05] We'll be sat under a starry sky
[01:56.63] Wishin' it never ended
[02:00.82] Every second spent
[02:06.44] Let's cherish it all
[02:10.40] Before all the lights that turned into
[02:13.60] Christmas comes again
[02:24.10] 
[02:17.01] Oh, oh, oh, no, no
[02:26.01] 
[02:29.33] Christmas comes again (Christmas comes)
[02:35.13] Sat under a starry sky
[02:39.20] Wishin' it never ends, oh, please
[02:43.78] Every second spent (every second)
[02:49.37] Let's cherish it all
[02:53.05] Before all the lights that turned into
[02:55.91] Christmas comes again
[03:06.41] 
[03:01.34] Oh, oh
[03:03.15] When Christmas comes again
[03:09.37] When Christmas comes again
